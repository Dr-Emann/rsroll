This is a fork of [`rollsum` crate](https://github.com/aidanhs/rsroll)
with some stuff added to be used in [`rdedup`](https://github.com/dpc/rdedup)
while the situation is figured out on mainline.

This crate will be under maintaince, until `rdedup` is using it,
and quite some effort was already put into it. If you're interested
in using it and/or in polishing this (or the mainstream create), please
let me know.
